# Object-Detection-with-Distance-Measurement
A real-time object detection and proximity warning system that combines Python (for computer vision and display) and Arduino (for ultrasonic distance sensing). The system detects when an object is closer than a predefined threshold and displays a visual warning box on the video feed.
